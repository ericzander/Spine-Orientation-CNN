### Description
> A [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) class project in which an ANN and CNN were built to identify the orientation of axial spinal cord images. Hyperband parameter tuning was performed with [Keras Tuner](https://keras.io/keras_tuner/). The results and formatting of this notebook were altered slightly following the actual submission, which achieved first place with an accuracy of **99.875%** on the 4000 test images.
